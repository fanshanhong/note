描述数据的数据，或者是数据的属性

Metadata is simply **data about data**. It means it is a description and context of the data. It helps to organize, find and understand data. Here are a few real world examples of metadata:



## Typical metadata

Those are some typical metadata elements:

1. Title and description,
2. Tags and categories,
3. Who created and when,
4. Who last modified and when,
5. Who can access or update.

## A photo

Relational databases (most common type of database) store and provide access not only data but also metadata in a structure called [data dictionary or system catalog](https://dataedo.com/kb/databases/all/data-dictionary). It holds information about:

- tables,
- columns,
- data types,
- constraints
- table relationships,
- and many more
